USER: Evaluate the following movie reviews on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very negative, 3 being neutral, and 5 being very positive:
1. This movie released on Nov. 18, 2019, was phenomenal. The cinematography, the acting, the plot - everything was top-notch.
2. Never before have I been so disappointed with a movie. The plot was predictable and the characters were one-dimensional. In my opinion, this movie is the worst one to have been released in 2022.
3. The movie was okay. There were some parts I  enjoyed, but there were also parts that felt lackluster. This is a movie that was released in Feb 2018 and seems to be quite ordinary.

USER: Analyze the following customer reviews from different sources for three different smartphones - the latest iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, and Google Pixel - and provide an overall rating for each phone on a scale of 1 to 10. Consider the following complex and contradictory reviews:
- TechRadar's review of the latest iPhone: The new iPhone is a stunning triumph of engineering that sets a new bar for smartphone performance and camera quality. However, the incremental design and high price mean it lacks the 'wow' factor of previous iPhones. Still, its power and intelligence are unrivaled.
- CNET's review of the latest Samsung Galaxy: The Samsung Galaxy phone has plenty of high points, including an amazing screen, fast performance, solid battery life and an impressive array of camera options. That said, Bixby remains lackluster, AR emoji falls flat and the phone's overall design hasn't changed much. The new Galaxy is an amazing phone overall, but it has a few nagging weaknesses that keep it from achieving true greatness.
- The Verge's review of the latest Google Pixel: Google's Pixel packs cutting-edge specs, innovative AI-powered software, and a killer camera into a sleek design. However, the phone has lackluster battery life, lacks expandable storage, and its performance stutters at times, especially considering its high price tag. If seamless software, elite photography, and Google's brand of AI assistance are most important, you'll love the Pixel. But the overall experience isn't as well-rounded as some competitors. Return the answer as a JSON object with the overall ratings for each phone out of 10, to one decimal place.
