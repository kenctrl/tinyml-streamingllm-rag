The Amazon, a mesmerizing expanse of nature's wonders, is home to the legendary Amazon River. Flowing through awe-inspiring landscapes like the Amazon rainforest, the river weaves its way through Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, giving life to countless creatures. From the mighty jaguars prowling the Amazon jungle to the vibrant macaws soaring above the canopy, this remarkable region teems with biodiversity. Deep within the river's currents, magnificent pink river dolphins gracefully glide alongside piranhas and electric eels. Along the riverbanks, you'll find bustling cities like Manaus, where the urban meets the wild, and Iquitos, a gateway to the heart of the Amazon rainforest. As you venture further, the Amazon River reveals hidden gems like the captivating Anavilhanas Archipelago, a mosaic of islands brimming with rare species. Embark on an adventure, explore the enchanting Amazon River, and immerse yourself in a world teeming with life and untamed beauty.

Yesterday, Adamson Emerson, the CEO of Faraday, and Dieter Zetsche, the CEO of Daimler AG, announced plans to build a new Gigafactory in Berlin. The facility will be a joint venture between Faraday and Daimler, producing electric vehicles and battery packs for both companies, creating thousands of job opportunities in the region. Emerson and Zetsche stated that the strategic location of Berlin, coupled with its skilled workforce and strong infrastructure, makes it an ideal choice for expansion. The new Gigafactory aims to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles in Europe and contribute to a sustainable future. Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess welcomed the news, saying greater collaboration will benefit the auto industry's transition to e-mobility.

USER: Analyze the following customer reviews from different sources for three different smartphones - the latest iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, and Google Pixel - and provide an overall rating for each phone on a scale of 1 to 10. Consider the following complex and contradictory reviews:
- TechRadar's review of the latest iPhone: The new iPhone is a stunning triumph of engineering that sets a new bar for smartphone performance and camera quality. However, the incremental design and high price mean it lacks the 'wow' factor of previous iPhones. Still, its power and intelligence are unrivaled.
- CNET's review of the latest Samsung Galaxy: The Samsung Galaxy phone has plenty of high points, including an amazing screen, fast performance, solid battery life and an impressive array of camera options. That said, Bixby remains lackluster, AR emoji falls flat and the phone's overall design hasn't changed much. The new Galaxy is an amazing phone overall, but it has a few nagging weaknesses that keep it from achieving true greatness.
- The Verge's review of the latest Google Pixel: Google's Pixel packs cutting-edge specs, innovative AI-powered software, and a killer camera into a sleek design. However, the phone has lackluster battery life, lacks expandable storage, and its performance stutters at times, especially considering its high price tag. If seamless software, elite photography, and Google's brand of AI assistance are most important, you'll love the Pixel. But the overall experience isn't as well-rounded as some competitors. Return the answer as a JSON object with the overall ratings for each phone out of 10, to one decimal place.

ASSISTANT: 1. Latest iPhone: 8.2
2. Samsung Galaxy: 8.5
