USER: Evaluate the following movie reviews on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very negative, 3 being neutral, and 5 being very positive:
1. This movie released on Nov. 18, 2019, was phenomenal. The cinematography, the acting, the plot - everything was top-notch.
2. Never before have I been so disappointed with a movie. The plot was predictable and the characters were one-dimensional. In my opinion, this movie is the worst one to have been released in 2022.
3. The movie was okay. There were some parts I  enjoyed, but there were also parts that felt lackluster. This is a movie that was released in Feb 2018 and seems to be quite ordinary.
