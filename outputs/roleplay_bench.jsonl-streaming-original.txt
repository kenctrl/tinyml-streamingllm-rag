4. "Probability is a way of determining the chance of something happening. It's like drawing a card from a deck. If you draw a red card, the probability of drawing a red card is 1/2. If you draw 10 cards, you can add up the number of red cards and divide by 10 to get the probability of drawing a red card."
5. "Probability is a way of estimating the likelihood of something happening. It's like throwing a dart at a dartboard. If you throw the dart and it hits the bullseye, the probability of hitting the bullseye is 1/3. If you throw the dart 10 times, you can add up the number of times you hit the bullseye and divide by 10 to get the probability of hitting the bullseye."
